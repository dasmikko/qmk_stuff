# dasmikko's Kyria Keymap

![Preview of the keymap](https://github.com/dasmikko/qmk_stuff/blob/main/images/kyria.png?raw=true)

The keymap is a pretty basic, no crazy tap-dance mods or alike. It is very beginner friendly, and feel free to use it as a base.

It uses Danish layout, so it includes ÆØÅ.

## Layers
There is 6 layers in total: Main, Nav, Synbol, Function, Adjust and Gaming. I've placed the layer buttons in the thumb region for easy access.

### Main
This the default layer, where you have the QWERTY layout.

Space and backspace is placed at the thumbs, for quick typing. Ctrl, Shift is placed where you expect it.

### Nav
This layer is for most navigational keys, like the arrow/media keys.

### Symbols
